# ALX Low Level Programming

Welcome to the ALX Low Level Programming repository! This repository documents my journey as a software engineering learner in the low-level programming track. Here, I'll share my solutions, projects, and progress as I explore various foundational concepts in software development.

## Directories

This repository is organized into directories based on the different modules and topics covered in the ALX low-level programming curriculum. Here's a brief overview of each directory:

- [`0x02-functions_nested_loops`](./0x02-functions_nested_loops): Understanding functions and nested loops in C.

- [`0x03-debugging`](./0x03-debugging): Exploring debugging techniques to identify and fix issues in code.

- [`0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops): Further practice with functions and nested loops.

- [`0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings): Introduction to pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

- [`0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings): Continued practice with pointers, arrays, and strings.

- [`0x07-pointers_arrays_strings`](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings): More exercises involving pointers, arrays, and strings.
